    "**Let us try to get daily Product revenue using retail tables**\n",
    " - daily is derived from orders.order_date.\n",
    " - product has to be derived from products.product_name\n",
    " - revenue has to be deriverd from order_items.order_item_subtotal.\n",
    " - we need to join all the 3 tables, then group by order_date, product_id as well as product_name to get revenue using order_item_subtotal\n",
    " - Get Daily Product Revenue using products, orders, and order_items data set\n",
    " - we have folloing fields in **orders.**\n",
    "     - **order_id**\n",
    "     - **order_date**\n",
    "     - **order_customer_id**\n",
    " - we have following fields in **order_items.**\n",

    "  - We have one to many relationship between products and order_items.\n",
    "  - **products.product_id** is **primary key** and **order_item.order_item_product_id** is foregin key to **products.product_id**\n",
    "  - By the end of this module we will explore all standard transformations and get daily product revenue using following fields.\n",
    "      - **orders.order_date**\n",
    "      - **order_items.order_item_product_id**\n",
    "      - **products.product_name**\n",
    "      - **order_items.order_item_subtotal** (aggregated using data and product and product_id).\n",
    "   - We will consider only **COMPLETE** and **CLOSED** orders.\n",
    "   - As there can be more then one product names with different ids, we have to include product_id as part of the key using which we will group the data."
